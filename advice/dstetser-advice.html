			<h4>Never Underestimate Yourself</h4>
			<p>When you embark on a new adventure, it may feel like you are a microbe in a great big ocean with no way to get out except to be eaten by the bigger fish. The first thing you need to do is embrace the fact that this feeling is natural and will ease with time and knowledge. It is ok to feel like you are sinking or that you will never get it. This is all part of learning something new.</p>

			<p>Confusion, frustration, the feeling of desolation will soon pass. Keep forging ahead and don't worry that you just don't quite get it. The more you practice, the more confident you will become. Stay postive, and never underestimate yourself. You are just as intelligent as the next person. Embrace it and know that you will grow and become the big fish in the big ocean. When you do, remember not to eat the little microbes!</p>

			<h4>Dust yourself off and get back on the horse and ride!</h4>
			<p>When learning a new language or a new skill, there will be times when you may fail or lose site of the end goal or even let life get in the way of your success. When this happens, don't fault yourself for it. It happens...life happens.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Part of learning anything is knowing that you won't be a super rock star at it from the start. You will falter, you will doubt youself, but you will get back up, dust yourself off, and get back in there are ride off into the sunset with your head held high and success on the horizong waiting for you. So get tackle that code, cause you've got this!</p>
